<h1>My Photo Gallery</h1>


<p> Taking photos is one of my favorite hobbies. Over the years I have accumulated many photos. I take photos of pretty much everything, such as portraits, nature, architecture and more. I enjoy editing them and sharing them with my friends to see. I also enjoy putting them in my room and anywhere I know I will enjoy them. Here are just a few of my favorites from over the years!</p>
